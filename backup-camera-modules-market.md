<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Backup Camera Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCD Cameras</li><li>CMOS Cameras</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The backup camera modules market is divided into two main types: CCD cameras and CMOS cameras. CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) cameras use a sensor that converts light into electrical charges to produce high-quality images with low noise levels. They are more expensive and consume more power. On the other hand, CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) cameras use image sensors that require less power and are less expensive to manufacture. They are commonly found in entry-level and mid-range vehicles, delivering satisfactory image quality with lower power consumption.</p></p>
