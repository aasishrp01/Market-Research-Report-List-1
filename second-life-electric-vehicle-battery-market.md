<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Second Life Electric Vehicle Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Second Life Electric Vehicle Battery (EV) market comprises two main types: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). BEVs run solely on battery power and do not have an internal combustion engine. They are powered by rechargeable batteries which provide them with an electric range. PHEVs, on the other hand, have both a battery and an internal combustion engine. The battery can be recharged by plugging into an electric power source, and the vehicle can also run on gasoline or other fuels when the battery is depleted.</p></p>
