<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-Ray NDT Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Screen Type Films</li><li>Non-Screen Type Films</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The market for Industrial X-Ray NDT Film can be categorized into two types: Screen Type Films and Non-Screen Type Films. Screen Type Films rely on a fluorescent screen during the X-ray process to create the image, while Non-Screen Type Films do not require a screen and are directly exposed to X-rays. Screen Type Films are commonly used for high-resolution applications and are more sensitive to lower X-ray energies. On the other hand, Non-Screen Type Films are often preferred for thicker materials or when lower resolution is acceptable.</p></p>
