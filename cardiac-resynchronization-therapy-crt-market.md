<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemakers [CRT-P]</li><li>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators [CRT-D]</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is a medical procedure used for treating heart failure patients with abnormal electrical pathways. CRT-P is a type of pacemaker that helps coordinate the heart's chambers to improve its pumping efficiency. It delivers small electrical signals to the heart as needed. On the other hand, CRT-D is a combination of a pacemaker and a defibrillator, which not only coordinates the heart's chambers but also provides shocks to restore normal heart rhythm if it detects dangerous irregularities. Both CRT-P and CRT-D are important devices in the market for managing heart failure.</p></p>
