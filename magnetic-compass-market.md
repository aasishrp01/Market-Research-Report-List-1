<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Compass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-reading</li><li>Distant-reading</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The magnetic compass market consists of two main types: direct-reading and distant-reading compasses. Direct-reading compasses are designed for immediate and accurate navigation readings. They feature a compass card that is directly aligned with the magnetic north and indicate the direction in real-time. On the other hand, distant-reading compasses are used for long-range navigation and provide navigators with a way to read the compass card from a distance, typically through a prism or mirror system. Both types cater to different navigation needs and play a crucial role in marine and aviation industries.</p></p>
