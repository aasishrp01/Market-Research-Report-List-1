<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultra-low-iron Glasse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Glass</li><li>Float Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ultra-low-iron glass market is divided into two main types: rolled glass and float glass. Rolled glass is made by passing the molten glass through a pair of rollers, resulting in a smooth and consistent sheet of glass. This type of glass is often used in applications where its clarity and high light transmission are important, such as solar panels. On the other hand, float glass is created by floating molten glass on top of a bed of molten metal, resulting in a flat and pristine surface. Float glass is commonly utilized in architectural and automotive industries due to its exceptional clarity and optical quality.</p></p>
