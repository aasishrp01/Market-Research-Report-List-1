<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Superphosphate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Water</li><li>Without Water</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single Superphosphate (SSP) is a type of fertilizer consisting of the nutrient phosphorus in a water-soluble form. In the market, SSP is available in two forms: With Water and Without Water. With Water SSP is produced by reacting sulfuric acid with phosphate rock in the presence of water, which results in a chemically bound form of phosphorus that is easily absorbed by plants. Without Water SSP, on the other hand, is produced by drying the With Water form, resulting in a granular product that is more convenient for transportation and storage but needs to be dissolved in water before application to unlock its phosphorus content.</p></p>
