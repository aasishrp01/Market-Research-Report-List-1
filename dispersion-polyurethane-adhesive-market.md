<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dispersion Polyurethane Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoset</li><li>Thermoplastic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Dispersion Polyurethane Adhesive Market comprises two main types: Thermoset and Thermoplastic. Thermoset polyurethane adhesive is a type that undergoes irreversible chemical reactions when exposed to heat, resulting in a hardened and non-melting material. In contrast, Thermoplastic polyurethane adhesive is a type that softens when heated and solidifies when cooled, allowing it to be melted and reprocessed multiple times without losing its adhesive properties. Both types find wide applications in various industries, such as automotive, construction, and electronics.</p></p>
