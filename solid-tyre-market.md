<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solid Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stick Tire</li><li>Non-stick Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solid tyre market can be divided into two types: stick tire and non-stick tires. Stick tires are designed to provide better traction and grip on various surfaces, making them suitable for off-road, construction, and mining vehicles. They have a sticky compound that offers enhanced adhesion and ensures smooth movement on uneven terrains. On the other hand, non-stick tires are formulated with less adhesive materials to reduce the build-up of dirt, mud, and debris. These tires are commonly used in industrial and urban areas where maintaining cleanliness is crucial for efficient operation.</p></p>
