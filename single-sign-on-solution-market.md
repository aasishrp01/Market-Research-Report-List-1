<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Sign-On Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OpenID Connect（OIDC）</li><li>Security Access Markup Language (SAML)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Single Sign-On Solution (SSO) market encompasses two prominent types: OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Security Access Markup Language (SAML). OIDC is an identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0, enabling authentication and authorization for web and mobile applications. It focuses on user authentication and allows websites to verify the user's identity using an ID token. On the other hand, SAML is an XML-based protocol that facilitates Single Sign-On across different domains. It ensures secure user authentication and exchange of authorization data between various parties involved in SSO operations.</p></p>
