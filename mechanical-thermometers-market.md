<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Thermometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bimetal Thermometer</li><li>Gas-Actuated Thermometer</li><li>Liquid Expansion Thermometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical thermometers market includes different types of thermometers such as bimetal thermometers, gas-actuated thermometers, and liquid expansion thermometers. </p><p>1. Bimetal Thermometer: These thermometers use the principle of two different metals expanding at different rates when heated. This expansion causes the bimetallic strip to bend, which is then converted into a temperature reading.</p><p>2. Gas-Actuated Thermometer: These thermometers use a gas-filled bulb connected to a capillary tube. When the temperature changes, the gas expands or contracts, causing the pressure to move an indicating needle on a dial, providing the temperature reading.</p><p>3. Liquid Expansion Thermometer: These thermometers operate on the principle of liquid expanding or contracting with temperature changes. The expansion or contraction of the liquid in a bulb or a capillary tube is converted into a temperature reading.</p></p>
