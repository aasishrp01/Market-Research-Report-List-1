<p><strong>The Spiral Pasteurizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DirectSteamHeating</li><li>IndirectSteamHeating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Spiral pasteurizers are used in the food and beverage industry to heat products for preservation. Direct steam heating is a type of spiral pasteurizer where steam is directly injected into the product, heating it and effectively killing any bacteria or microorganisms. Indirect steam heating, on the other hand, involves the use of a heat exchanger where steam indirectly heats the product, ensuring that there is no direct contact between the steam and the product. Both methods are widely used in the market, offering different benefits depending on the specific requirements of the product being pasteurized.</p></p>
