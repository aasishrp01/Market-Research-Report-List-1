<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tuberculosis Vaccination Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immune Vaccine</li><li>Therapy Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Tuberculosis Vaccination Market can be categorized into two types: Immune Vaccine and Therapy Vaccine. Immune Vaccine aims to prevent tuberculosis infection by stimulating the immune response in individuals. It typically uses weakened or killed bacteria to trigger an immune reaction. On the other hand, Therapy Vaccine is designed to treat individuals already infected with tuberculosis. It focuses on boosting the immune system to fight the infection effectively. Both types play a crucial role in combatting tuberculosis and reducing its impact on public health.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Tuberculosis Vaccination Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Procurement</li><li>UNICEF</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Tuberculosis (TB) Vaccination Market consists of three major applications: Self-Procurement, UNICEF, and Other markets. In Self-Procurement, countries or organizations directly purchase TB vaccines from manufacturers to meet their own vaccination needs. UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, procures vaccines on behalf of low- and middle-income countries, ensuring access and affordability. The Other market encompasses private hospitals, clinics, and individuals who procure TB vaccines outside of government or UNICEF channels. All three applications play vital roles in the distribution and availability of TB vaccines globally.</p></p>
