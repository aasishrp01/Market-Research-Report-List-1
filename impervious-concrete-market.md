<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impervious Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Impervious Concrete</li><li>Admixture Impervious Concrete</li><li>Expansive Impervious Concrete</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Impervious concrete is a type of concrete that has low porosity and is resistant to water penetration. There are three main types of impervious concrete: Ordinary Impervious Concrete, Admixture Impervious Concrete, and Expansive Impervious Concrete. Ordinary impervious concrete achieves its water resistance through dense aggregate and low water-to-cement ratio. Admixture impervious concrete involves the addition of chemical compounds that enhance water repellency. Expansive impervious concrete utilizes an expansive additive to create small cracks that are then filled, improving water resistance. These different types cater to specific construction requirements and are used in various applications.</p></p>
