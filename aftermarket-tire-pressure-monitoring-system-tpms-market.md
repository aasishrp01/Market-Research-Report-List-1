<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market includes two types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses individual sensors on each tire to monitor the pressure, providing accurate real-time data. It is more expensive but offers precise measurements. Indirect TPMS relies on the wheel speed sensors of the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) to estimate tire pressure based on rotational differences. It is less expensive but can be less accurate and require recalibration. Both systems aim to enhance safety and fuel efficiency by alerting drivers of low tire pressure.</p></p>
