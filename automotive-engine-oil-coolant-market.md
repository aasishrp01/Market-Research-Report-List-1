<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Engine Oil Coolant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooled</li><li>Liquid Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive engine oil coolant market can be divided into two types: air cooled and liquid cooled. Air cooled systems dissipate heat through the flow of air over the engine, using fins and heat sinks. This type of cooling is commonly found in motorcycles and small engines. On the other hand, liquid cooled systems use a coolant fluid to absorb heat from the engine and then transfer it to a radiator, where it is cooled by airflow. This type is more common in cars, larger engines, and high-performance vehicles.</p></p>
