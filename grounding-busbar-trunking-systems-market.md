<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grounding Busbar Trunking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Segregated Bus Duct</li><li>Nonsegregated Bus Duct</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grounding busbar trunking systems are used to distribute electrical power in buildings. The segregated bus duct market refers to a system where the conductors for power and grounding are physically separated within the trunking. This helps to minimize electromagnetic interference and ensure electrical safety. On the other hand, the nonsegregated bus duct market involves a system where power and grounding conductors are within the same trunking, allowing for a simpler and more cost-effective installation. However, this design may increase the risk of electrical noise and requires careful attention to grounding practices.</p></p>
