<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corrosion and Scale Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corrosion Inhibitors</li><li>Scale Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Corrosion inhibitors are substances that are used to protect metal surfaces from corrosion, which is the process of gradual deterioration caused by chemical reactions of the metal with its surrounding environment. These inhibitors work by forming a protective layer on the metal surface, preventing corrosive substances from coming into contact with the metal.</p><p>On the other hand, scale inhibitors are chemicals used to prevent the formation of scale in various industrial processes. Scale refers to the deposition of mineral salts, such as calcium or iron, which can accumulate on surfaces and impede the flow of fluids. Scale inhibitors prevent the formation and accumulation of scale by either dispersing the scale-forming compounds or by inhibiting their crystallization.</p></p>
