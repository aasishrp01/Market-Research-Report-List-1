<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electric damper actuators are devices used to control the opening and closing of dampers in HVAC systems. There are two main types: spring return damper actuators and non-spring return damper actuators. Spring return damper actuators use a torsion spring to close the damper when power is lost, providing fail-safe operation. Non-spring return damper actuators do not have a spring and rely on a motor to maintain positioning, even during power loss. Both types of actuators are crucial in maintaining proper ventilation and temperature control in buildings.</p></p>
