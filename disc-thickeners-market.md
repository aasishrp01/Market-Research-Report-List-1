<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disc Thickeners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous</li><li>Batch</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Disc thickeners are commonly used in wastewater treatment processes to concentrate sludge or separate solid particles from liquids. There are two main types of disc thickeners available in the market: continuous and batch. Continuous disc thickeners operate continuously, allowing for continuous sludge thickening. On the other hand, batch disc thickeners work in cycles, where sludge is added and thickened in batches. Continuous disc thickeners are suitable for processes with a steady flow of sludge, while batch disc thickeners are more suitable for processes with intermittent sludge flows or smaller volumes.</p></p>
