<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The XPS Polystyrene Foaming Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Foaming Agent</li><li>Physical Foaming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The XPS polystyrene foaming agent market comprises two types: chemical foaming agent and physical foaming agent. Chemical foaming agents, commonly used in the production of XPS polystyrene, release gas upon heating, creating a foaming effect. These agents are typically compounds containing nitrogen or carbon. On the other hand, physical foaming agents rely on mechanical means to introduce gas into the polymer, often using nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the blowing agent. Both types contribute to the expansion and foam formation of XPS polystyrene materials.</p></p>
