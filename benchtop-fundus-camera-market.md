<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Benchtop Fundus Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mydriatic</li><li>Non-mydriatic</li><li>Hybrid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The benchtop fundus camera market consists of three main types: mydriatic, non-mydriatic, and hybrid fundus cameras. Mydriatic fundus cameras require the use of dilating eye drops to enlarge the patient's pupils, allowing for a more detailed examination of the retina. Non-mydriatic fundus cameras, on the other hand, do not require pupil dilation, making the process quicker and more convenient for both patients and practitioners. Hybrid fundus cameras combine features of both mydriatic and non-mydriatic cameras, offering the flexibility to choose between dilation or non-dilation imaging techniques based on the patient's needs.</p></p>
