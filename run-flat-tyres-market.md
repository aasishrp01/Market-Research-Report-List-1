<p><strong>The Run-Flat Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-supporting</li><li>Self-sealing</li><li>Auxiliary-supported</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The run-flat tires market includes three main types: self-supporting, self-sealing, and auxiliary-supported tires. Self-supporting run-flat tires are built with reinforced sidewalls that can temporarily support the vehicle's weight even after air pressure loss. Self-sealing tires have an inner lining that seals punctures automatically, preventing air loss. Auxiliary-supported tires come equipped with a support ring or insert that bears the vehicle's weight when there is a loss of air pressure. These types provide drivers with alternatives to traditional tires and help ensure safety and mobility in case of emergencies.</p></p>
