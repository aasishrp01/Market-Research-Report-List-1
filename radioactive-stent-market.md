<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radioactive Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retrograde Stents</li><li>Antegrade Stents</li><li>Internal (double-J) Stents</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Radioactive Stent market includes various types of stents used for medical purposes. Retrograde stents are inserted through a backward approach, suitable for situations like ureteral strictures. Antegrade stents are inserted through a forward approach, typically used for treating kidney or ureter blockages. Internal (double-J) stents are designed with a "J" shape and are used to manage blockages in the upper urinary tract. These stents allow the passage of fluid and are commonly employed after surgeries or to relieve obstructions caused by conditions like kidney stones.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Radioactive Stent Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lithotripsy</li><li>Ureteroscopy</li><li>Ureteroenoscopy</li><li>Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The market for radioactive stents is primarily used in lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, ureteroenoscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy procedures. Lithotripsy involves using shock waves to break down kidney stones, while ureteroscopy and ureteroenoscopy involve inserting a thin tube into the urinary tract to remove or treat stones. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a surgical procedure that involves accessing the kidney through a small incision to remove large or complex kidney stones. Radioactive stents can be used in these procedures to provide targeted radiation therapy to reduce the risk of stone recurrence or to treat tumors.</p></p>
